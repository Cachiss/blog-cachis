# Cachis blog made with Astro and its blog template

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template blog
```

## Who am I?
I'm a software developer from Querétaro, México. I'm currently studying in the [Universidad Tecnológica de San Juan Del Río](https://www.utsjr.edu.mx/) and sometimes I work as a freelancer developer.
I really want to improve my frontend skills and I think that a blog is one of the best ways to do it.

## A little bit more about me
Always I've been a fan of the technology and as a zgen kid I grew up with the internet and the videogames so I think that for these reasons I'm a software developer. But I'm not only a tech guy, my favorite passion in the life is the literature, I think that I'm trying to find the life's meaning and phylisophy and poetry are strong ways to help me, so you can follow me in my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/134372947-marcos-camacho) account. (I don't upload reviews but maybe in the future I'll do it)
